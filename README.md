# LDFAWE (Limitless Development Fast Async World Edit)

LDFAWE is a fork of the legacy [FAWE](https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit) mod which aims to improve upon
WorldEdit with new features and large performance improvements.

Unlike the legacy [FAWE](https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit) mod which supported versions 1.8 - 1.12 for
Bukkit, Forge, Sponge, and Nukkit, the development of Mica Minecraft LDFAWE is focused primarily on Forge 1.12.

### Other Minecraft Versions

#### 1.7.10

For those who are looking for Forge 1.7.10 support, user [KAMKEEL](https://github.com/KAMKEEL) has made a fork for
1.7.10 called KAWE (Kam's AsyncWorldEdit).
You can find it at [https://github.com/KAMKEEL/KAWE](https://github.com/KAMKEEL/KAWE).

## Documentation

Documentation for LDFAWE is currently available via the legacy [FAWE](https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit)
mod's wiki: https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit/wiki

* A standalone, dedicated Wiki for the LDFAWE mod is planned. If and when the feature set or commands diverge from the
  upstream version, the Wiki will be created to ensure accurate, up-to-date documentation.

## Official FAWE Mod

Information about official versions of the FAWE mod can be found
at https://intellectualsites.gitbook.io/fastasyncworldedit/.

Legacy versions of the official FAWE mod which support Forge 1.12 are no longer supported.

of Forge through their own forks or contributions. Support for other versions of Forge is not guaranteed.
