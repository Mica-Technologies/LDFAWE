# LDFAWE (Limitless Development Fast Async World Edit)

LDFAWE is a fork of the legacy [FAWE](https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit) mod which aims to improve upon
WorldEdit with new features and large performance improvements.

Unlike the legacy [FAWE](https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit) mod which supported versions 1.8 - 1.12 for
Bukkit, Forge, Sponge, and Nukkit, the development of LDFAWE is focused primarily on Forge 1.7.10 and 1.12 respectively. The version for 1.12 in this repo is maintained by the Mica Minecraft team, while the version for 1.7.10 is maintained independently as a separate fork of the same name in a different repo by KAMKEEL.

## Documentation

Documentation for LDFAWE is currently available via the legacy [FAWE](https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit)
mod's wiki: https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit/wiki

* A standalone, dedicated Wiki for the LDFAWE mod is planned. If and when the feature set or commands diverge from the
  upstream version, the Wiki will be created to ensure accurate, up-to-date documentation.

## Official FAWE Mod

Information about official versions of the FAWE mod can be found
at https://intellectualsites.gitbook.io/fastasyncworldedit/.

Legacy versions of the official FAWE mod which support Forge 1.12 are no longer supported.
